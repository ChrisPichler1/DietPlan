# DietPlan
This is a diet tracker that I created for myself that has the ability to track any macro (or micro) nutrient that you would like to track. For myself, I track my Calories, Protein, Carbs, Sugar, Fat, Saturated Fat, and Sodium content. The food items are objects containing
the amount of nutrients in each food item. Additionally, I can create a Day object that holds how much of each macronutrient I had during a 24 hour period. When I have 7 Day objects, I can use the Day objects to add up how much of each macro I've had in the week, and
print it out nicely in the console so I know if I hit each goal. This diet plan can be personalized to anybody who has the ability to understand the syntax of Java. The nutrients that the Food objects hold, the goals of each Day and Week, and what is printed to the
console can be personalized to fit anybody's goals. I use this Diet Tracker every day to see if I've hit my goals, and the code in this repository has not been changed from what it looks like on the day that I posted it in order to show what it looks like mid-week. 
I hope you enjoy how much of each macro I've consumed in the Day and Week objects in the main method.
